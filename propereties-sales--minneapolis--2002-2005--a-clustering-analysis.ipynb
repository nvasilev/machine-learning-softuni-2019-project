One of the advantages of the age we are living in is the abundance of data available to us and the data-processing tools which are at our disposal which we could use to harness the insights we could find in that data.\n",

    "The Minneapolis Assessor's Office tracks and records every real property transaction in the city as also it makes this information public. The goal of this work is to use the means of Machine Learning clustering and to establish a standarised way of identifying what are the key factors which defines the property market structure and help real estate agents, investors and future buyers take better informed decisions.\n",

    "1. A standard set of pre-processing actions follow, including data de-duplication, scaling, indicator variables creation and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "1. Clustering analysis is applied using various algorithms, namely KMeans++ Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering and Density Based Clustering Analysis (DBSCAN) with the accompanying visual methods for clustering verification such as Elbow Method, dendrogram diagrams and cluster silhouette profiles.\n",
    "1. After the identificaiton of the most optimal number of clusters for the dataset, characterisation of these clusters is attempted by using: (1) geographical distribution of the properties in each cluster, as well as (2) statistical labeling of the most frequent property features found in each cluster and (3) pivot plot analysis of the property prices for each cluster and their relation to several other properties such as ward, neighbourhood and property type."
